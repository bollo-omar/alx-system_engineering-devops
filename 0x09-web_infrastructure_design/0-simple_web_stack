1. User requesting the website: The user accesses the website by entering the domain name www.foobar.com in their browser.

2. Server: A server is a computer system that provides services to other computers or devices on a network. In this case, the server is hosting the website for www.foobar.com.

3. Domain Name: A domain name is a unique name that identifies a website on the internet. In this case, foobar.com is the domain name, and it is configured with a www record that points to the server's IP address 8.8.8.8.

4. DNS Record: The www record in www.foobar.com is a DNS record that indicates the hostname of the web server that should be used to serve requests for the domain.

5. Web Server (Nginx): It is responsible for serving static content and reverse proxying dynamic requests to the application server. It is the entry point for all requests coming to the website.

6. Application Server: It is responsible for running the application code and processing dynamic requests that are received from the web server.

6. Database (MySQL): It is used to store the application's data and is responsible for processing database queries that are made by the application server.

7. Communication: The server uses the HTTP protocol to communicate with the computer of the user requesting the website. When a user enters www.foobar.com in their browser, the request is sent to the server using the HTTP protocol, and the server responds by sending back the website's content.

## Issues with this infrastructure:

- Single point of failure (SPOF) is present in the infrastructure as there is only one server. If the server fails, the entire infrastructure may be affected.
- Downtime may occur when maintenance is needed, such as deploying new code or restarting the web server.
- The infrastructure cannot scale if there is too much incoming traffic, as it is limited to the resources of a single server.i
