Infrastructure Requirements:

1.Add 1 server
2.Add 1 load balancer (HAproxy) configured as a cluster with the other one
3.Split components (web server, application server, database) with their own server

Explanation of additional elements:

1.Additional server is added to split components
2.Load balancer is used to distribute incoming traffic
3.Load balancer is configured as a cluster for redundancy
4.Separating web server, application server, and database improves performance and maintenance

Objectives of the infrastructure:

1.Improve scalability
2.Improve fault tolerance
3.Improve performance

Benefits of the infrastructure:

- Each component has the resources it needs to function optimally
- The infrastructure can handle more traffic and prevent resource contention.
