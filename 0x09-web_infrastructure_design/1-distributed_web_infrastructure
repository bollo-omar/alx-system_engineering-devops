1.In this diagram, the Load Balancer distributes incoming traffic across the two Application Servers. Each Application Server has Nginx installed to serve web pages, and both servers use the same set of Application Files. The servers connect to a single Database (MySQL) for data storage.

2.The Load Balancer is configured with a Round Robin distribution algorithm, which cycles through each of the available servers and sends traffic to each one in turn. This ensures that traffic is spread evenly across the servers.

3.The Load Balancer is set up in an Active-Passive configuration, where one server is active and the other is passive. The active server receives all incoming traffic, while the passive server is on standby in case the active server fails. In the event of a failure, the passive server takes over as the active server.

3.In the Primary-Replica database cluster, the Primary node serves as the master database, while the Replica node serves as a slave database that replicates the data from the Primary node. The Replica node can be used for read-only queries, while write queries must be sent to the Primary node. This setup provides fault tolerance and high availability for the database.

## The main issues with this infrastructure are:
- the potential for single points of failure,
- security vulnerabilities such as the lack of a firewall and HTTPS encryption,
- there is no monitoring set up to track performance and identify potential issues.
